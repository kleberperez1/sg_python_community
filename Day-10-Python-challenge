#Option 2: 
#Difficulty Level: Pre-Intermediate:  
#The greatest common divisor of two positive integers, n and m, is the largest number,
#d, which divides evenly into both n and m. There are several algorithms that can be used 
#to solve this problem, including: Initialize d to the smaller of m and n.

# Python code to demonstrate gcd()
