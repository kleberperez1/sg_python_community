# Option 1:
# Difficulty Level: 
# Elementary: In this exercise you will create a program that displays a multiplication table that shows the products of all combinations of integers from 1 times 1 up to and including 10 times 10. Your multiplication table should include a row of labels across the top of it containing the numbers 1 through 10. It should also include labels down  the left side consisting of the numbers 1 through 10. 

# Multiplication table (from 1 to 10) in Python (To run this cell press Ctrl+Enter)
b, c, count = '   ', '   ', 0
for i in range(1, 11):
    if i > 9:
        b += str(i) + '  '
        c += str(i) + ' '
    else:
        b += str(i) + '   '
        c += str(i) + '   '
    for a in range(1, 11):
        d = str(a*i)
        for letter in d:
            count += 1
        c += str(a*i) + ' '*(4-count)
        count = 0
    c += '\n   '
print((' ')*4 + b)
print(c)

#Option 2: 
#Difficulty Level: Pre-Intermediate:  
#The greatest common divisor of two positive integers, n and m, is the largest number, d, which divides evenly into both n and m. There are several algorithms that can be used 
#to solve this problem, including: Initialize d to the smaller of m and n.

# Python code to demonstrate gcd() 
import math 

print("Calculate the Greatest Common Divisor by entering 2 numbers..")
n = int(input("Number one: "))
m = int(input("Number two: "))

print (f"The gcd of {n} and {m} is: ",end="") 
print (math.gcd(n,m)) 

# End Option 2 ***
